This is a detailed list of changes per version.

- Releases sometimes have separate posts that describe new features, like for
  [version 0.6](/about/v-0-6/), [version 0.8](/about/v-0-8/), and [version
  0.9](/about/v-0-9/)).

- Visit [**what's next**](/about/whats-next/) to get a sneak peak into what
  we're going to be working on next.

## Please note

- **Stable, released versions are recommended,** unless we specifically suggest
  you try out a pre-release build.

- "Pre-release" builds (those that end with `alpha` or `beta`) have not been
  thoroughly tested, and may not even launch.

- Only run `alpha` or `beta` builds if you have [recent
  backups](/faq/how-do-i-safely-store-files/).

## v0.9.1-beta.5

**2020-11-06**

- 🐛 Windows system recovery volumes are now ignored (prior releases could fail
  health checks if a system recovery volume wasn't healthy, but we never use
  those volumes, so we ignore them now).

- 🐛 The embedded SQLite binary didn't run properly on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (it did
  work on 20.04, though). I've rebuilt the binary on 18.04 x64 and it seems to
  work properly now.

- 🐛 Prior versions of PhotoStructure may have added non-normalized tags.
  Current versions of PhotoStructure assumed all tags were normalized, which
  would prevent these tags from being cleaned up. A new migration was added to
  force all tags into normalized form.

- 📦 Health check warnings and failures are now pushed out in a progress panel
  shown on the home page, to make sure people see that their system is failing a
  health check.
  
- 📦 v0.9.1-beta.4 PhotoStructure for Desktops for linux was built on an Ubuntu
  20.04 box (as the SSD on my Ubuntu 18 box died _during the upload of the
  build_). This caused beta.4 to not launch properly on 18.04 boxes 😢.
  
  I've rebuilt my 18.04 box, and beta.5 should restore Ubuntu 18 compatability.

## v0.9.1-beta.4

**2020-11-04**

- ✨ Experimental support for HDR imagery. See [this reddit
  post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhotoStructure/comments/jk3319/p3_color_support/).
  You'll need to rebuild your library (available via the main navigation menu)
  to rebuild previews, or run "Re-sync this asset" from the `⋮` menu on the
  asset page to just try one example first. If you have P3-gamut source images,
  and an HDR display, please share how this works for you!

- ✨ Clickable elements with multiple keyboard shortcuts now list all shortcut
  options.

- ✨ `vi` users, rejoice: you can now navigate between assets with <key>j</key>
  and <key>k</key> (synonyms to <key>left</key> and <key>right</key>)

- ✨ `./photostructure info --volumes` is now supported (to get volume metadata
  from the command line rather than the About page).

- 🐛 "Manual" [scan paths](/about/v-0-9/#-scan-path-improvements) was broken for
  docker users in v0.9.0: they had to select "automatic" to continue. Version
  0.9.1 adds (working!) support for manual scan paths for docker users.
  Apologies if you got bit by this bug!

- 🏃💨 **Large library owners, rejoice**: tag pages, even for large libraries,
  render in < 100ms now! The home page in prior versions could take upwards of
  1.5 seconds to render, due to several expensive database queries. One of the
  most expensive queries was library asset counting due to the way
  PhotoStructure's hierarchical tags are structured. v0.9.1 adds materialized
  asset and asset file counts. Prior queries could take 200-300ms per tag to
  count assets, and another 300ms to count asset files. These counts are now
  automatically updated periodically. 🎉

- 🏃💨 **Image hashing speed has been improved** for larger images (in some cases,
  like panoramas, 10x faster! This was due to a call to `sharp.trim()` to
  automatically remove letterboxed embedded thumbnails. `trim()` can take 5-10
  seconds to run on larger images, though, and larger images are never
  letterboxed, so image hashing skips the trim() on larger images now).

- 🏃💨 **Sync import parallelism has been improved.** Due to the way videos are
  transcoded, only 1 or 2 videos can be processed at any given time. In prior
  versions, if the next N files in the work queue are all videos, PhotoStructure
  would refuse to start additional work, in effect "single-threading" the sync.
  This version detects this scenario and pops off eligible work from elsewhere
  in the queue.

- 🐛 In some cases when many assets shared the same captured-at time, the asset
  stream wouldn't present the correct images. This has been fixed.

- 🐛 Tags from prior imports that are no longer correct or relevant are now
  removed by the "Resync this asset", "Sync", and "Rebuild."

- 🐛 Errors raised from `sync-file` due to health check failures (which are
  expected from parsing or importing problematic files) are logged but not
  propagated to the main service (which would then shut down PhotoStructure).

- 🐛 PhotoStructure opens a "filesystem watcher" for the library opened-by file,
  to get notified if the library is unmounted or has lost it's open lock. This
  error may fail of the library is stored on a remote filesystem. This error is
  now logged and ignored (as we also poll for the lock when health checks run).

- 📦 PhotoStructure's UI will now automatically reload with the new frontend
  code when the server's version is found to have changed (like after updating
  to a new version). This should avoid confusion caused by people expecting new
  features, but running the prior frontend code (because they haven't hit
  refresh on their browser). You can tell if you're running a new UI by clicking
  the nav menu and see the running version next to the "About" button.

- 📦 PhotoStructure now knows how to parse date-timestamps from macOS and gnome
  screenshots: `y-M-d 'at' H.m.s` and `y-M-d H-m-s`.

- 📦 Retries on database lock timeouts have progressively longer
  wait-before-retry times. This may help reduce spurious db timeouts after
  retries.

- 📦 `#snapshot` directories (found on newer Synology drives) and any non-hidden
  `lfs/objects` directories are now ignored automatically. (Scanning these
  snapshop directories could add many, _many_ duplicates to your library).

- 📦 Updated all dependencies to latest-stable, and switched from `node-sass`
  (which was deprecated) to `sass` (I didn't see any CSS compilation
  differences, but please tell me if you see anything!)

## v0.9.1-beta.3

**Released 2020-10-28**

- 📦 Sure enough, new versions of sharp and electron still don't agree with
  eachother on PhotoStructure for Desktops on Ubuntu, so this version rolls back
  to Electron 9 and sharp 0.23 😢.

- 📦 All other third-party libraries are now latest-stable.

## v0.9.1-beta.2

**Released 2020-10-27**

- 📦 New `greyscaleColorThreshold` setting for monochrome image detection. The
  previous hard-coded default of `3` is now `5`, which should allow greyscale
  images with slight off-white balance to still be considered greyscale.

- 📦 New versions of sharp, electron, and typescript have been pulled in. Note
  that the new version of sharp produces slightly different image hashes and
  dominant colors in some cases, but the differences are not large enough to
  break deduping heuristics and warrant a rebuild (thank goodness). We had to
  hold off on upgrading sharp for v0.9 due to incompatibilities with
  AppImage-packaged electron builds, so this change may need to be reverted
  (again) if integration tests don't go smoothly.

- 📦 Performance improvements to `logcat`, "send recent logs," and error
  reporting in general.

- 🐛 More URI work: `psfile://` uris, specifically, are normalized both in
  parsing and generation now. This normalization on reads and writes should
  prevent DUPLICATE_KEY errors that some beta users were experiencing.

## v0.9.1-beta.1

**Released 2020-10-26**

- ✨ Keywords are now shown in the Asset Info panel

- 🐛 Asset header on iPad displays shouldn't overlap anymore

- 🐛 Added a migration to normalize and de-dupe asset files. Libraries from
  pre-version-0.9 and current libraries used a different URI library which
  resulted in different encoding for the same file. This migration may take 5-20
  seconds to apply. Your asset file count may drop after this migration is
  applied.

- 📦 New `excludedRootTags` library setting to omit problematic keywords

- 📦 The "resync this asset" command now forcefully rebuilds metadata, tags, and
  previews for the asset.

- 📦 Upgraded to Webpack 5 (resulted in slightly smaller packages)

## v0.9.1-alpha.2

**Released 2020-10-24**

- 🐛 Added a migration to apply recursive tag de-duping. If you see duplicate
  root tags (like 2 "When" tags) on the home page, this migration should address
  that.

## v0.9.1-alpha.1

**Released 2020-10-23**

- ✨ Error reporting can now be enabled or disabled via the settings page

- 🐛 PhotoStructure libraries from pre-v0.6 had migrations that could have prevented launching.

- 🐛 The "What's new?" link on the About page hadn't been updated for v0.9.

- 📦 Several non-fatal errors (like corrupt JPEGs) were downgraded (to prevent
  `sync-file` from restarting unnecessarily)

- 📦 The navigation menu order used to be

  - (home, root tag links)
  - (about, help)
  - (settings, sync, shutdown)

  We flipped the order to be

  - (home, root tag links)
  - (settings, sync, shutdown)
  - (about, help)

  Several beta users on smaller monitors hadn't realized there was a third
  section (which is arguably more important than the about/help links).
  Hopefully this will help.

## v0.9.0

**Released 2020-10-19**

[**See our v0.9 version announcement**](/about/v-0-9/)

### Your feedback is requested!

🙏🏾 Every feature and bug fix in this release is directly due to beta users'
suggestions, or via their assistance. Thank you!

🛡️ This version includes several new security enhancements, updates to several
major dependencies, and hundreds of other changes, both visible and behind the
scenes.

🍜 This version _really will_ be the last beta release before we introduce free
and premium tiers. We are giving discounts to the beta users that give us
feedback (both positive and negative), and help debug any issues they find.
[Please see this post for more details about subscriptions and
pricing](/about/v-0-8/#-thanks-to-our-testers-this-will-be-our-last-beta-version).

🐞 As always, **if things don't seem to work correctly, or you find anything odd or
confusing or buggy, please [email us](support@photostructure.com)**.

### Settings changes

- ✨ We've updated the "Where are your photos and videos?" section:

{{< figure src="/img/2020/09/scan-paths-old.png" caption="Prior settings from version 0.8.3 and earlier" >}}

{{< figure src="/img/2020/09/scan-paths-new.png" caption="New settings from version 0.9.0" >}}

- The scanning options are now just "automatic" or "manual".

- To examine your Pictures directory click "Add My Pictures directory."

- PhotoStructure for Desktop users have an "Add" button to browse and add local
  directories. You can click it multiple times to add additional paths.

- PhotoStructure scans paths in the order you specify in this list (even if
  you're in "automatic" mode).

- This isn't available on PhotoStructure for Docker users, as PhotoStructure
  scans all bind-mounted volumes automatically.

### Features & enhancements

- 🛡️ Strict [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) with
  nonces are now enabled. **If you experience page loading errors or see problems in
  your console, please report them to support@photostructure.com.** You can
  disable CSP enforcement with the [library setting](/getting-started/advanced-settings/#library-settings) `cspReportOnly`. Also see the new
  `cspDirective` system setting for reverse-proxy users.

- ✨ During library rebuilds, assets are now excluded from your library if _any_
  file that was already imported is found to be in a [NoMedia](/nomedia)
  directory.

  If you want to keep assets that have variations found in other directories,
  set the `excludeNoMediaAssetsOnRebuild` [library
  setting](/getting-started/advanced-settings/#library-settings) to `false` to
  retain prior behavior.

- ✨ The complete set of [settings](/getting-started/advanced-settings/) is now
  published to github and included in Docker images as a `defaults.env` file.
  See the new [environment variables](/faq/environment-variables) documentation
  for more information.

- ✨ The number of thumbnails to show per "[tag
  sample](/about/introducing-photostructure/#samples-to-keep-you-interested)" is
  now dynamic, based on both thumbnail size and screen size.

- ✨
  [UNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_%28computing%29#Universal_Naming_Convention)
  paths (`\\server\share\path\to\file.jpg`) are now supported both for libraries
  and for scan paths, but please note that _free space cannot be monitored for
  these devices_. We still recommended that you map your network drive to a
  drive letter, so PhotoStructure can monitor and pause imports if the volume
  gets too full.

- ✨ The "show streams" button on the asset page is now iconic (rather than just
  a down arrow), with busy and close states (which should help discoverability
  of asset streams)

- ✨ Tags are now sorted and stored case-insensitively.

- ✨ Transcoded video encoded max bitrates are now configurable via
  `transcodeBitrateQVGA` and `transcodeBitrateUHD`. Videos with
  resolutions between QVGA and UHD will interpolate between these values.

- ✨ For MacPorts users: a new `toolPaths` setting is now configurable, and
  now includes `/opt/local/bin` on Linux and macOS.

- 💔 The `forceLocalDbReplica` setting is now on by default for Docker
  users. This caused issues with a bunch of beta users, and having it on when
  not needed only makes shutdown a bit slower (as the database needs to be
  copied back into the library).

- ✨ Volume UUID reading and writing is now disableable via Settings.

- ✨ On startup, and periodically while running, PhotoStructure will validate the
  library database. If it is found to have inconsistencies, the database is
  rebuilt automatically (via SQLite's `.dump` or `.recover`). If this process
  fails, though, please [follow these instructions](/faq/restore-db-from-backup/).

- ✨ PhotoStructure will refuse to start if it detects that a library is from a
  newer version of PhotoStructure. Newer versions of PhotoStructure can open and
  upgrade older libraries, however, and the library database upgrade process is
  automatic.

- 📦 The default value of `fuzzyDateImageCorrWeight` was changed from
  1.2 to 1.5. This makes PhotoStructure much more discriminating when it
  de-duplicates photos that don't have a precise date (like from scanned
  images).

- 📦 Release notes are now available from the main navigation menu from
  within PhotoStructure, as well as the footer on photostructure.com pages.

- 📦 Docker `:beta` tags now automatically pull in the last build from either
  `beta` or `main` branches.

- 🛡️ We're now using Electron's `contextBridge` for the render process, and
  pass all [Electronegativity](https://github.com/doyensec/electronegativity)
  security audits.

- 📦 Localhost is now configurable (so users can try binding to either
  `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` if they are fighting [firewall
  issues](/faq/troubleshooting/#windows-firewall-issues))

- ✨/🐛 More types of unhealthy volumes are now ignored, rather than preventing
  PhotoStructure from starting.

- ✨ Several new binary thumbnail variants are now inspected, which can speed up
  imports of certain RAW images.

- ✨/🐛
  [Samples](/about/introducing-photostructure/#samples-to-keep-you-interested)
  are picked randomly from child tags. The prior implementation biased strongly
  towards more recent assets (which is why you'd see mostly photos from January
  in the When samples!)

- ✨ Captured-at times are extracted from several more tags now. Rather than
  using "first-one-in-wins," PhotoStructure now picks the earliest time with the
  highest resolution.

<a id="pill-streams"></a>

- ✨ Stream tags got a redesign to make each tag more visually distinct, and less
  "busy" when there are many tags:

{{< figure src="/img/2020/09/stream-tags-old.png" caption="Prior stream tags" >}}
{{< figure src="/img/2020/09/stream-tags-new.png" caption="New stream tags in v0.9.0-beta.2" >}}

- ✨/🐛 Progress reports from the web service used to poll the database every
  couple seconds. When no sync is running, polling drops to every 10 seconds,
  which should reduce idle CPU consumption.

- ✨ When viewing duplicate assets, zoom is now supported (previous versions
  disabled zoom if you were viewing an asset variant). View these variants by
  opening the asset info panel (click the "i" when viewing an asset). Click a
  file path to toggle viewing that image instead of the top, "shown" asset file.

- ✨ New "pause zoom" mode: you can now "freeze" the current zoom and pan
  position. Toggle this mode by tapping either the <key>p</key> or the
  <key>pause</key> key.

  This mode lets you compare different asset file variants while zoomed in, or
  to compare next and previous assets. This is especially handy when comparing
  focus or smiles between shots.

- 🐛/✨ Browsing on smaller screens has been improved:

  - Long headers truncate to ellipses before overlapping
  - Tags in asset streams are shortened to just `parent/child`
  - Asset contents now show under the asset info panel

- ✨ [**Tools**](/tools) now support `--force-open` (please read the `--help`!) and
  `main` has a `--pause-sync` for starting the service "paused" (if you want to
  prevent sync from running until you manually resume via the navigation bar).

- 📦 [**Systemd service
  configuration**](/server/photostructure-for-node/#step-6-set-up-a-systemd-service)
  was added to the PhotoStructure for Node instructions.

- 📦 Added `--stop-timeout` and `stop_grace_period` to the [**docker**](/server/photostructure-for-docker/) and
  [**docker-compose**] recipes. This should make restarts via docker more reliable (as
  PhotoStructure will have sufficient time to [shut down
  cleanly](/faq/how-to-start-and-stop-photostructure/#why-does-it-take-so-long-to-shut-down)).

- ✨ All elements in the UI with keyboard shortcuts now include the key in their
  tooltip.

- ✨ [Library metrics](/metrics) were added to the About page

- ✨ Progress reports are now stored for each instance (like a library rebuild,
  volume import, or volume synchronization). This helps in debugging, and
  enables progress reports to discern between initial directory imports and
  subsequent directory synchronizations.

- ✨ Face tiles from iPhoto are now excluded automatically.

- 🐛/✨ As directories are scanned, files that have been deleted will be removed
  from the library as well.

- ✨ Logfiles from more than a week ago are removed automatically to reduce disk
  consumption.

- ✨ All UI widgets that have keyboard shortcuts now say what their shortcut is
  in their tooltip.

### Bug fixes

- 🐛 Fixed several asset stream rendering issues that could result in the UI
  "hanging."

- 🐛 Assets on the home page are automatically refreshed during initial import
  until there are roughly 200 library assets.

- 🐛 **Non-English locale support**: Users whose system locale was not "`POSIX`"
  may have seen a number of different bugs, including failure to launch.
  PhotoStructure now forces the locale for child processes to `C` which should
  address this issue.

- 🐛 "Click to toggle showing this file" in the Asset Info panel works (again).

- 🐛 Sync/import progress reconnects automatically on service restarts.

- 🐛 Fixed AssetFile URI encoding errors for paths that had special characters.
  This could prevent prior versions of PhotoStructure from successfully
  importing files that had "special" characters. Please run "sync" if you think
  you may have been impacted.

- 🐛 The asset info panel now linebreaks very long pathnames properly.

- 🐛 String comparisons are now locale-sensitive.

- 🐛 Fixed system icon tooltip text (it said `function () { ...`)

- 🐛 The [`info` tool](/server/tools/) no longer elides deep object fields

- 🐛 Added more robust race-condition handling for file caches (this mostly
  impacted high-cpu-count systems)

- 🐛 Binary keyword fields are now properly ignored. (PhotoStructure previously
  interpreted ExifTool's `(Binary data 32 bytes, use -b option to extract)` as a
  _keyword_, oops!).

- 🐛 Tags with equal-prefix siblings are now handled correctly. Previous
  versions of PhotoStructure would show assets tagged with `/Camera/HTC` under
  both `/Camera/HT` and the correct tag.

- 🐛 Beta users with year-old libraries are migrated gracefully now.

- 🐛 Keywords with URLs are no longer parsed as hierarchies, but considered a
  single "keyword" that is the URL.

- 🐛 Internal filesystem and metadata caching has been changed from LRU to FIFO.
  Some caches (like asset counts) weren't updating properly due to this.

_(note that this release had been called v0.8.4 in earlier release notes. That
version's changes have been rolled into v0.9.0.)_

## v0.8.3

**Released 2020-07-29**

Every feature and bug fix in this release is directly due to beta users'
suggestions or their assistance. Thank you!

- 💔 The `PS_REQUIRE_MAKE_MODEL` setting is now **disabled by default**. This
  filter, when enabled, prevents PhotoStructure from importing files that don't
  have a Make or Model tag, which prevents images like screenshots from filling
  up your library. Unfortunately, this also prevents images downloaded from
  Facebook/Instagram, and SMS. So far **no** beta users have wanted this enabled
  once they learned of the setting, which might be a good clue that the default
  was bad.

- ✨/🐛 Improved the reliability of date extraction for photos and videos that
  have no dates in their metadata. Two new settings were added,
  `PS_USE_PATHS_TO_INFER_DATES`, and `PS_FUZZY_DATE_PARSING`, which can be used
  to disable PhotoStructure's default behavior that attempts to extract
  captured-at times from paths when metadata is missing from the asset, and to
  use more relaxed date parsing.

- ✨ De-duping greyscale images has been improved. If you have a number of
  greyscale photos in your library, please run `rebuild` to regroup your
  library's assets.

- ✨ De-duping of files without precise dates has been improved by requiring more
  stringent image correlation. This is controlled by the
  `PS_FUZZY_DATE_IMAGE_CORR_WEIGHT` setting.

- ✨ Added new `PS_STRICT_DEDUPING` library setting. Set to true if you don't want
  image edits to be grouped together with raw images. NOTE: This will most
  likely cause RAW and JPEG pairs to not always merge to the same asset,
  especially if your camera uses extensive computational imagery.

- ✨ When viewing an asset, the automatic header and button hiding-on-idle is now
  disabled whenever the asset info panel is shown (thanks to beta users for the
  suggestion!)

- ✨ Library rebuilds now report on the files that are being processed.

- 🐛 Zombie prevention within Docker: The Dockerfile now use `tini` as the default `ENDPOINT`,
  which reaps zombie processes properly. The docker image is a bit larger now,
  but we don't have to rely on users using `--init` (only available on more
  recent versions of Docker or Docker Compose).

- 🐛 System settings are now written on startup if outdated or missing

- 🐛 If PhotoStructure rebuilt a portion of your library every time you
  restarted, this should be fixed now. We were trying to rebuild missing files,
  but we'll update those files when they re-appear.

- 🐛 A race condition in the image cache that could prevent assets from being
  imported was fixed.

- 🐛 Non-default array settings (like `PS_PREVIEW_RESOLUTIONS`) are now
  correctly handled

- ✨/🐛 Suggested library directories are removed if they are not writable

- ✨/🐛 On Windows, we now read from the system registry to get the user's
  Pictures directory.

- ✨/🐛 Improved date parsing for file basenames to require year, month, and day
  (prior versions would interpret an image with no metadata named "1958.jpg" as
  coming from the year 1958 (!!)).

- ✨/🐛 Logging errors in v0.8.2 would cause the prior only-held-in-RAM logs to
  get flushed to disk (to help debug issues later). Unfortunately, several
  fairly common things were being logged as errors (rather than warnings), which
  caused logs to get big quickly. These have been addressed.

- ✨/🐛 Renamed the `ls` tool to `list`. This tool now has `--dirname` and
  `--orderby` parameters.

- 📦 Added [documentation for tools](/server/tools/).

- 📦 Added instructions for installing PhotoStructure for Node on Windows 10.

- 📦 Enabled tree-shaking in the front-end javascript build (size dropped from
  260KiB to 218KiB).

- ✨/🐛 PowerShell is now spun up with `-NoLogo`, which may allow profile scripts
  that are slow to pass desktop pre-flight checks.

- ✨/🐛 v0.8.1 and v0.8.2 had different versions of `sharp` between the Desktop
  and Server editions of PhotoStructure, which could result in slightly
  different image hashes. The version is now consistent across editions.

- 📦 The docker `WORKDIR` is now `/ps/app`, so running commands ad-hoc are the
  same as on PhotoStructure for Node: just `docker exec -it photostructure sh`
  and then `./photostructure --help` or `./photostructure info`.

- 🐛 `logcat` now handles very large inputs.

- 🐛 The cache directory wasn't clearing fast enough in v0.8.2. The "vacuum"
  process would eventually run, but caches could grow to 20gb on a fast enough
  machine under prior default settings. The cache time has been reduced by 3/4
  and the vacuum is scheduled to run more often.

## v0.8.2

**Released 2020-07-11**

- 🐛 [NoMedia](faq/how-to-hide-directories/) directories weren't respected. They are now only cached for a minute.

- ✨ Filesystem metadata (including UUID and NoMedia) is cleared when you pause
  and then resume the library import and sync processes (available via the
  system tray or system navigation menu).

- ✨ Service setup has a timeout to prevent zombie processes. This timeout can
  now be overridden with the `PS_SETUP_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable.

- 🐛 Added a per-volume timeout to gracefully handle mountpoints that are in an
  unhealthy state (which is fairly common on Windows).

- 🐛 Lens metadata matching "unknown" is now ignored.

- 🐛 NFS remote mountpoint metadata is now parsed correctly.

## v0.8.1

**Released 2020-07-09**

[**See our v0.8 version announcement**](/about/v-0-8/)

#### General updates

✨ 🧭 **Easier navigation**

Click the new navigation button in the top-left part of the screen for access to

- Root tags, like "When," "Camera," "Keywords," and "File Type"
- The About and Settings pages
- Links to control the sync process and shut down PhotoStructure
- The getting started and support pages on <https://photostructure.com/>

PhotoStructure for Servers users: this gets you to feature parity with Desktop
users that have enjoyed these links in their system tray menu.

PhotoStructure for Desktop users on Linux and Windows: hit the <key>alt</key> key to see
your new menu bar.

✨ 🚅💨 **Faster sync**

Library synchronization is much faster in this release.

In prior versions, PhotoStructure watched CPU utilization and only scheduled new
work when your system was "idle enough." In practice, this resulted in
under-scheduling. On slower or busier systems, imports ran so slowly that they
didn't complete.

PhotoStructure now runs all child processes with a
[nice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_%28Unix%29) or
[BelowNormal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.processpriorityclass?view=netframework-4.8)
priority level. This allows your operating system schedule work much more
efficiently. Your system should remain responsive while simultaneously running
synchronization tasks substantially faster, especially on multi-core systems.

The new `cpuLoadPercent` and `processPriority` settings allow for tuning this behavior.
Please email us (hello@photostructure.com) if you need to tweak the defaults for
your system.

✨ 💽💨 **Faster writes**

Prior versions serialized all database writes through the web process. This
slowed down writes, and could make the UI less responsive during imports.

PhotoStructure now uses SQLite's WAL mode to allow all processes to write
directly to the database. This speeds up writes as well as allows the web UI to
stay responsive, even during imports.

✨ 📹💨 **Faster video transcodes**

If you're importing videos, and you're using FFmpeg, we now import videos in
parallel, which can substantially improve import speeds. VLC does not support
parallel imports. See our [video installation
instructions](/getting-started/video-support/) for more details.

✨ 💪 **More robust error handling in the UI**

While browsing, if an asset is found that can't be rendered due to an incomplete
import, unmounted filesystem, or any other error, PhotoStructure will redirect
you to the nearest valid asset as you browse while it runs a background repair
job to try to fix the asset.

✨ 📨 **More download options**

The asset info panel now lets you download the original, large, medium, and
small resized versions of your images. These smaller versions are handy for emails or
texts, and are available on the first asset file's `⋮` button.

✨ 📹 **Video support improvements**

Video duration and FPS, if available, are now shown in the Asset Info panel.
Duration and FPS will need to be backfilled for all videos in your library, and
will happen automatically after you upgrade to this version.

Transcoding is (by far!) the most expensive operation that PhotoStructure has to
do during the import process, and has been refined in this new released. Previous
versions transcoded all videos not in `video/mp4` format.

PhotoStructure now provides a
[setting](/getting-started/advanced-settings/#library-settings),
`doNotTranscodeMimetypes`, which adds three more commonly-supported video types
to avoid transcoding (as most browsers on most OSes can natively render them).

✨ 🔄 **More robust rotation support**

When you rotate your photos or videos with PhotoStructure, it now applies image
content matching to ensure **all asset file variants** for the asset you rotated
are in the same visual orientation.

Note that rotation is a non-destructive operation by writing a sidecar with the
orientation next to your original. This behavior can be changed to edit in place
with an [advanced library
setting](/getting-started/advanced-settings/#library-settings).

✨ 🏷️ **Hierarchical keyword support**

PhotoStructure now extracts hierarchical keywords from `Categories`, `TagsList`,
`LastKeywordXMP`, `HierarchicalSubject`, `CatalogSets`, and `Subject` tags.

For non-hierarchical keyword sources, like pathnames, PhotoStructure splits by
commas and semicolons. For example, `car, blue, tree` will be interpreted as
having the keywords `car`, `blue`, and `tree`. This is configurable via the
`keywordDelimiters` setting.

PhotoStructure interprets keywords as “heirarchies”, or “paths”, when a keyword
includes one or more of the characters `/`,`|`,`>`,`≻`, or `⊃`. Note that on
windows, there can be issues with filenames that have forward slashes, vertical
bars, or greater-than characters, so use the alternatives. This allows for tags
like `Family|Einstein|Albert`, `Flora ⊃ Fruit ⊃ Orange`, or
`Fauna > Oceanic > Pelican`. This is configurable via the new
`keywordPathSeparators` setting.

✨ 🌍🌏🌎 **Better unicode support**

Filenames and directories with non-latin characters should now be supported
properly.

#### More frontend updates

- ✨ 🔎 New [zoom loupe control](/zoom)
- ✨ 💬 Chat widget on the settings and about pages, to get just-in-time help
  from our global team of friendly customer service agents (ok, it's just me)
- ✨ The settings page now shows which suggested library paths are already PhotoStructure libraries.
- ✨ **See your dupes**: You can now view all Asset variants on both mobile and
  desktop views. Open the Asset info panel, and click on the pathname to view
  that file's image. If the image is RAW, it will be converted to JPG so your
  browser can render it.
- ✨ Asset streams are centered around the current asset now.
- 🐛 On some mobile browsers, child tags and assets didn't always lazy-load. A
  `Load More ...` button now shows when needed.
- ✨ The Asset Streams panel on the bottom no longer overlays on the current
  photo.

#### Tagging improvements

- 📦 The cache directory on linux is now `~/.cache/PhotoStructure`. It had
  previously been in `/tmp`. This can be changed via the `PS_CACHE_DIR`
  environment variable, or the `cacheDir` [system
  setting](/getting-started/advanced-settings/#system-settings).
- ✨ All taggers can be enabled or disabled via new library settings.
- ✨ New `Type` tag, so you can view all videos, or all images of a specific type
  (see `tagType`).
- ✨ Date tagging can be "year", "year/month", or "year/month/day" (see
  `tagYMD`).
- ✨ Date tagging can be limited to only non-`stat` values (see
  `tagDateFromStat`).
- ✨ Lens tagging can use the full lens model (like "Canon EF-M 15-45mm f/3.5-6.3
  IS STM") or a just the lens information ("15-45mm f/3.5-6.3") (see
  `tagFullLensModel`).

#### Backend improvements

- ✨ New "Rebuild library" option from the navigation menu.
- ✨ sidecar files use the full filename now, so image "pairs" (like JPG +
  RAW) can have differing metadata values. For example, for `IMG_123.JPG`, both
  `IMG_123.XMP` and `IMG_123.JPG.XMP` will be considered relevant sidecars for
  that file, and the enclosed metadata tags will be overlayed on the original
  image in order of newest-written-file-wins.
- 🐛 RAW image dimensions should be more accurate now.
- 🐛 Paths can now have non-latin characters.
- 🐛 Unicode keywords (both in ICMP/EXIF headers and in pathnames) are now
  supported.
- 🐛 Prior versions could persist settings that were set by command-line
  arguments or environment variables making it the new “default” value. If you
  had problems with the settings page not saving your values, this should fix
  that.
- 🐛 If an asset doesn't have a metadata-encoded captured-at, we now infer the
  captured-at from the basename (if the file is named something like YYYYMMDD),
  and if no date is found in the basename, we examine the parent directory path.
- ✨ Improved make and model parsing for more cameras and smartphones.
- ✨ Image hashing has been sped up dramatically for images that have embedded
  thumbnails. Most original JPEG and RAW images have these thumbnails.
- ✨ Dominant color extraction is faster, more accurate, and dominant color
  comparisons now use more accurate color perception correlation.
- ✨ Idle background tasks, like `exiftool` and `sync-file` are shut down
  automatically when they are idle to reduce system resource consumption.

#### PhotoStructure for Servers updates

- 💔 The `start-docker.sh` and `photostructure.env` scripts have been deleted.
  No beta users (to my knowledge) used them, `docker-compose` changed their
  configuration format arbitrarily and had a questionable installation
  procedure, so it felt like it was just more moving pieces just to support
  upgrades. (If you want easy image upgrades, try <https://www.portainer.io/>!).
  The instructions for Docker have been rewritten and are much simpler to follow.
- 💔 The `PS_CONFIG_DIR` is now directly written to. Prior versions would write
  to `$PS_CONFIG_DIR/PhotoStructure`, which was surprising to several beta
  users. Please `mv $PS_CONFIG_DIR/PhotoStructure $PS_CONFIG_DIR` before
  upgrading your image.
- ✨ Node.js version 12 and version 14 are now supported. 12 is now the minimum.
- ✨/📦 PhotoStructure for docker now uses Node.js v14 and Alpine. This dropped
  the image size from 1.5GB to 300M.
- 🐛/💔 Alpha, beta, and release builds post to different git branches and
  different docker tags now. Previously, PhotoStructure for Servers users pulled
  in the latest build, which might have been an alpha or beta pre-release.
- ✨ Instructions for building `libvips` (required to support `.heic`) were added
  to the README. Note that the docker image does _not_ support `.heic`/HEVC, due
  to licensing and patent restrictions. **Tell Apple to switch to AV1!**
- 📦 For PhotoStructure for Node users, if the version of PhotoStructure or
  Node.js changes between runs, `./start.sh` automatically rebuilds
  `node_modules` as required.
