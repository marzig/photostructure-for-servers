# should be a reasonable balance between keeping your system responsive and

# PS_POLL_INTERVAL_MS="60000"


# +–––––––––––––––+
# |  probationMs  |
# +–––––––––––––––+
#
# Normally when subsystems crash, PhotoStructure restarts them after a delay.
# Unfortunately, if there is a persistent error, this means PhotoStructure
# keeps trying something that won't ever work; it looks busy, but it's just
# busy failing. To prevent this situation, PhotoStructure will shut down if
# there are high error rates within 2 minutes of starting. (2 minutes should
# be long enough to spin up the web process, sync process, and import at least
# one pending file). Setting this to 0 will prevent PhotoStructure from
# exiting due to high error rates.

# PS_PROBATION_MS="120000"


# +–––––––––––––––––––+
# |  processPriority  |
# +–––––––––––––––––––+
#
# By default, PhotoStructure runs child processes with a "below normal"
# priority, so your system remains usable while imports run. Changing this
# value to "normal" or "above normal" may speed up imports but cause your
# system to be unresponsive. Changing this value to "idle" may prevent imports
# from running at all.
#
# Valid values: AboveNormal,Normal,BelowNormal,Idle
